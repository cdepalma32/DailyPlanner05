# DailyPlanner05
# 🏗️ Module 5 Challenge

* This application is a simple calendar which allows a user to save events onto local storage by inputting information in time-blocks between the hours of 9am-5pm.  Using jQuery and Day.js, we can dynamically work with current date and time as well as running the application in the browser, showing past, present or future when the information is rendered into the time-blocks.  
The current day displays at the top of the calendar, as well as color-coded time blocks (dependent on past, present or future) for the user calendar input, the functionality of text event saving to the local storage, as well as the save persisting after refreshing the page are some changes that were added and now render in the application, after adding and modifying the starter code!
